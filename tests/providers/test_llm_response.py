"""Regression tests for ``LLMResponse.should_execute_tools`` (#3220).

The agent used to execute tool calls whenever ``has_tool_calls`` was true, regardless
of ``finish_reason``. Non-compliant API gateways that inject empty / bogus tool calls
under ``refusal`` / ``content_filter`` / ``error`` pushed the agent into a tight loop
until ``max_iterations`` fired. ``should_execute_tools`` is the single guard that
every tool-execution site now funnels through.
