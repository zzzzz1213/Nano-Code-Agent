# Tool Usage Notes

Tool signatures are provided automatically via function calling.
This file documents non-obvious constraints and usage patterns.

## exec — Safety Limits

- Commands have a configurable timeout (default 60s)
- Dangerous commands are blocked (rm -rf, format, dd, shutdown, etc.)
- Output is truncated at 10,000 characters
- `restrictToWorkspace` config can limit file access to the workspace
- For coding tasks, prefer project-native checks (`pytest`, `ruff check`, package build/test scripts) after the smallest relevant edit.

## grep — Content Search

- Use `grep` to search file contents inside the workspace
- Default behavior returns only matching file paths (`output_mode="files_with_matches"`)
- Supports optional `glob` filtering (e.g. `glob="*.py"`) plus `context_before` / `context_after`
- Supports `type="py"`, `type="ts"`, `type="md"` and similar shorthand filters
- Use `fixed_strings=true` for literal keywords containing regex characters
- Use `output_mode="files_with_matches"` to get only matching file paths
- Use `output_mode="count"` to size a search before reading full matches
- Use `head_limit` and `offset` to page across results
- Prefer this over `exec` for code and history searches
- Binary or oversized files may be skipped to keep results readable
- Before editing unfamiliar code, search for existing implementations, tests, and docs that define the local pattern.

## cron — Scheduled Reminders

- Please refer to cron skill for usage.
